<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>
  Every single person at the involved at the PDXKBC meetup, on the PDXKBX
  subreddit, or on the PDXKBC Discord is required to follow this code of
  conduct.
</p>

<h2>Short Version</h2>

<p>
  PDXKBC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for
  everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
  religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate
  harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is
  not appropriate for any meetup venue, including workshops, parties, and other
  online media. Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
  expelled from the meetup at the discretion of the meetup organizers.
</p>

<h2>Long Version</h2>

<p>
  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
  identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
  appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual
  images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
  harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
  events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
  immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
  particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other
  material. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup
  organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
  offender or expulsion from the meetup with no refund. If you are being
  harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
  concerns, please contact a member of meetup staff immediately. Meetup staff
  are listed above, and wear nametags that say <b>STAFF</b>. Meetup staff will
  be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts,
  or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
  duration of the meetup. We value your attendance. We expect participants to
  follow these rules at all meetup venues and meetup-related social events.
