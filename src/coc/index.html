      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p>
        Every single person involved with or at the PDXKBC meetup, on the PDXKBC
        subreddit, or on the PDXKBC Discord is required to follow this code of
        conduct.
      </p>

      <h2>Short version</h2>
      <p>
        PDXKBC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for
        everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age,
        sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
        ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not
        tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language
        and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including
        workshops, parties, and other online media. Meetup participants
        violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup at
        the discretion of the meetup organizers.
      </p>

      <h2>Long version</h2>
      <p>
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
        identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
        appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices,
        sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
        following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
        talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
        sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
        expected to comply immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the
        anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use
        sexualized images, activities, or other material. If a participant
        engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organizers may take any action
        they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from
        the meetup with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that
        someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
        contact a member of meetup staff immediately. Meetup staff are listed
        above, and wear nametags that say <b>STAFF</b>. Meetup staff will be
        happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide
        escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe
        for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance. We expect
        participants to follow these rules at all meetup venues and
        meetup-related social events.
